# My second repository

## An explaination
I am writing this quick little readme file so that if you stumble onto this repository you can understand why it is here.

This was a assignment I completed when I was trying to complete a practice assignment for a course.  You can find the repository for the course at [this link.](https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench)

## Thanks
